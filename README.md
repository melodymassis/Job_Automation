***Machine Learning***

1) Customer sentiment analysis: I currently read dozens of reviews on my top items to get a sense of what is the customer saying about the product and deals I present to them online. 
Goal: leverage open API https://github.com/walmartlabs/walmart-api 
walmart.reviews(itemID)

2) Pricing Optimization: As I merchant I look at these variables for 5+ hours a day to make decisions on pricing and assortment: 
    - Inventory Availability: Current on hand + On orders by date
    - Competitor's pricing
    - Sales goals by day
    - Item seasonality
  
  Goal: Leverage machine learning to automate this process and execute recommended pricing by day/hour to maximize sales
